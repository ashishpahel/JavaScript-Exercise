// Define a function that takes two parameters
function sumNumbers(num1, num2) {
  // Add the two parameters and store the result in a variable
  const sum = num1 + num2;
  // Return the sum
  return sum;
}

// Call the function and output the result to the console
console.log(sumNumbers(5, 10)); // Output: 15

/*
The function is named sumNumbers and takes two parameters, num1 and num2, which represent the two numbers to be added together.
Inside the function, the two parameters are added using the + operator and the result is stored in a variable named sum.
Finally, the sum variable is returned by the function using the return statement.
To test the function, we can call it with two numbers as arguments and output the returned value to the console using console.log(). In this case, we are passing 5 and 10 as arguments, so the output will be 15.
